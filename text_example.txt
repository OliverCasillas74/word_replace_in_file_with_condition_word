DESCRIPTION
       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.
       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h is supplied.
       A  FILE  argument  string  of  - is handled specially and causes touch to change the
       times of the file associated with standard output.
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
       -a     change only the access time
       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files    link
change -d, --date=STRING                link 
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

change -h, --no-dereference              link
              affect each symblinkc link instead of any referenced file (useful only on sys‚Äê
